# MyDevEnv2 Outstanding Uplift Backlog

This is the single canonical backlog for remaining uplift work in MyDevEnv2.
Completed uplift work lives in normal repo history, README status notes, and
the code itself. No other markdown file should carry a parallel open-items
backlog.

## Stack / Ops

1. **Bearer-token risk boundary** (`server/src/auth.rs`, `deploy/docker-compose.yml`)
   Repo-side audit logging, per-token mutation rate limits, and scoped token
   capabilities now exist. The remaining work is provisioning real non-admin
   tokens in production, moving the live clients onto them where appropriate,
   and deciding whether the primary token should keep full Docker-adjacent
   access long term.

## Mobile / Android

1. **Real-device native FCM verification**
   `google-services.json` already includes the `com.sprooty.mydevenv2` client;
   the remaining work is confirming first-launch FCM registration and end-to-end
   delivery on actual Android hardware.

## Suggested Priority

1. Bearer-token risk boundary
2. Real-device native FCM verification
