"""The shipped deployment artefacts obey the rules that broke cadastre.

`DEPLOYMENT.md` §4.1 records the incident these assertions exist for: the
port, TLS path and token path were `${X:?}`-gated required values, `verify`
and `publish` went green, and the deploy step went red because three values
were never set. The gate was protecting against nothing — the ports bind a
Tailscale address, so choosing them is an allocation inside the tailnet.
